# sitemap-crawler
The site I was working on has a generated site map. The way that the site map is generated means that there is a chance some pages are missing.

Because writing code is much more fun than manually checking each page I hacked together this module.

I'll hopefully spend some time cleaning it up, adding tests, linting and a CLI at some point...
